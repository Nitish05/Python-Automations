# File Management Scripts

This repository contains two powerful Python scripts designed to aid in file management tasks: one for consolidating files from various subdirectories into a single directory, and another for sorting files within a directory into folders based on their file extensions. These scripts are invaluable tools for organizing files and directories efficiently.

## Scripts Overview

### File Consolidation Script

- **Purpose**: Moves all files from subdirectories within a specified source directory to a single target directory.
- **Features**:
  - Deep directory traversal.
  - Automatic conflict resolution by renaming duplicate filenames.
  - Simplifies file organization by consolidating files into one location.

### File Sorting Script

- **Purpose**: Sorts files in a given directory into folders based on their file extensions.
- **Features**:
  - Automatic sorting into extension-named folders.
  - Works recursively through all levels of subdirectories.
  - Streamlines the organization of files by type.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Both scripts require Python to be installed on your system. They are compatible with Python 3.x versions.

### Installation
